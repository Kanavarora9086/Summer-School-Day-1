HTML Portfolio - Tags Explanation
This is my explanation of the HTML tags I used in my portfolio project. I tried to write it simply like I understand it.
1. <!DOCTYPE html>
This is written at the top to tell the browser that I’m using HTML5. It helps the browser know how to read my code.
2. <html>
This tag is like the main box that has all the HTML stuff inside. I also added lang='en' to show my website is in English.
3. <head>
Inside the head I put things like <title> (for the page name in the tab), <meta> (so all characters work), and <link rel='icon'> (to show my logo in the tab).
4. <body>
All the stuff that we see on the website is written inside the body tag.
5. <header>
This is at the top and I used it to write the main heading and also add my navigation links.
6. <nav>
This tag is for navigation. I put links to other pages like Home, About, and Contact here using <a> tags.
7. <a>
These are anchor tags. I used them to link one page to another like from Home to About page.
8. <main>
Main tag is where I wrote the actual content like my photo, skills, education, etc. It’s the big middle part.
9. <h1> to <h6>
These are heading tags. <h1> is biggest and most important. <h6> is smallest. I used them to show different sections like Skills, Projects, etc.
10. <p>
Used for writing paragraphs. I used this tag when I wanted to write more about myself.
11. <ul> and <ol>
<ul> is for bullet points and <ol> is for numbers. I used them to list my skills and education.
12. <li>
It’s a list item. Goes inside <ul> or <ol>. Each thing I want to list I put inside <li>.
13. <img>
I used this tag to show images like my photo and my project screenshot. I added alt text too in case image doesn’t load.
14. <form>
I used form in contact page to collect user name, email, message etc. It helps to make input fields.
15. <input> and <textarea>
These are inside form. Input is for short answers (like name, email) and textarea is for long message.
16. <label>
Label gives name to input box so user knows what to type. Like Name, Email, etc.
17. <footer>
Footer comes at bottom of page. I used it to write copyright line.
That’s what I learned and used in my HTML project.
